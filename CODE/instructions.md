This code template provides you with some starting points for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) case study! It is outlined as follows. \
- First we install all of the packages that we need to use for this project. Make sure you download these packages as needed.\
- Then we load in the data and make the rename the columns to make it easier to reference and use. \
- After that, we will crete a simple line graph of this data, with CPI on the y axis and year on the x axis. Because this is timeseries data, a line graph is best suited to show trends. \
- Next, this template will give you the numrical ARIMA resutls for this data. Use this to draw conlcutions and for further analysis.\
- Finally, this template will create an offset dataframe that you will use to create a predictive model. \
- Now it's your turn to code! Use this template along with the ARIMA article resourse to create a predictive model of CPI for the next decade. For this model, make sure to use the future_df dataframe to create a predictive figure for the next 120 observations. There are future instuction in the TODO.
